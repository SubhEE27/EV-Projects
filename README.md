# ⚡ Electric Vehicle Projects 🚗

This repository showcases my work in **Electric Vehicle (EV) system design**, focusing on **MATLAB/Simulink simulations**, **custom PCB development**, and a **3D CAD model** of an e-rickshaw. These projects combine theoretical modeling with hands-on engineering to develop subsystems of electric mobility solutions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements
- MATLAB R2021b or later with Simscape and Simulink
- Autodesk Eagle or Fusion 360 for PCB and CAD files
- LTspice (optional for analog circuit validation)

### How to Use
- Open `.slx` files in MATLAB/Simulink to simulate system behavior
- Open `.brd` or `.f3d` files in Eagle or Fusion 360 for design viewing or editing
- Each folder contains documentation, schematics, and simulation data
